**OVERVIEW**

TopoRock is an app to find Rock Climbing spots near your location. The second part is the be able to add new places to the DB, considering you need to add the location (coordinates), picture of the place and some information.

As the server is not implemente and I'm using a backup API I found online, you only need to run "npm install" on the client directory and then "npm start".
